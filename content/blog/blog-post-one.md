# Sample Markdown

This is some basic, sample markdown.

## Second Heading

- Unordered lists, and:
  1. One
  2. Two
  3. Three
- And more

> Blockquote

And **bold**, _italics_.

[A link](https://markdowntohtml.com)

And code highlighting:
```js
var foo = 'bar';

function baz(s) {
  return foo + ':' + s;
}
```

The end ...
